This is an Maven Project for displaying a 3D Modelling

To run this project , Please install Maven and JDK and setup respectively in Environment Variables. 

The Input file is present in "input/input.txt"
To render new model for new input, change content of input to desired input 

This is my first Computer Graphics Project, And I am having issues running it from CMD. 
I have run the project after importing it to IDE, and running "mvn clean install javafx:run"

For the same reason above , I had to start from scratch to see how Graphics with Java runs. 

I have used SPheres to show POints on the plane and used cylinders to show lines. 
Adding Width/2 to X cordinates and Substracting Y cordinate from HEight/2 gives us the shifted cordinates to shift the model from Origin to Centre of Screen.

For rotation, I have tried to rotate with new axis, but for some reason , my rotation axis is fixed on x=y axis. 
Following are some rotation Screenshots.

I agree this documentation is crude and not well formated, But There are only few modules for which i can document, as i dont have experience in Graphics. 

If given time , I can work on some tutorials and get to know more abt computer graphics, since my previous experience has been in Web tech for 5 years in Java.
